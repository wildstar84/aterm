2024-08-10  JWT:

	* Update from their original vsn# 1.00.02 to 2.00.00, as this fork is a
	  major release (1st new aterm release in over 20 years)!

	* Add 3 new non-standard delete functions:
	  (Delete to EOL, Delete to BOL, & Delete line: escape codes: \E[?3K,
	  \E[?4K and \E[?5K) for convenience.  

	  Also added corresponding keyboard and menu-support:  
	      Control+k deletes to EOL, (menu action seq:  "^^k" or "^@\E[?3K^G")
	      Shift+Control+K to BOL,   (menu action seq:  "^^K" or "^@\E[?4K^G")
	      Shift+Delete the entire line typed. (menu action seq: "^@\E[?5K^G")
	  See the updated mymenu.menu file changes for example menu entries.

	* Menubar:  Added support for right-side menubutton packing:  
	  Menubuttons are added packed to the left side of menubar.  By adding
	  a ">" preceeding a top-level menu name in menu config file, it will now 
	  be packed on the right side.

	* Added a "NO_MENUBAR_ARROWS" compile-time option to not include the 4 
	  arrow buttons at right end of menubars (which by default are always 
	  visible and simply emulate the 4 corresponding arrow keys on the 
	  keyboard).  If built with this option defined, some memory will also be 
	  saved, as the code that produces these arrow-buttons will not be 
	  compiled in! (see feature.h for setting this).

	* Scrollbar:  Made colors & transparency work properly:  
	  1) aterm provides 2 color resources:  scrollColor & troughColor, but
	  neither were being used (Scrollbars were always an ugly stippled light-
	  gray Motif look).  Now actually USE these colors if specified.
	  2) Make transparency actually work (transparent to screen if aterm 
	  window is transparent, and the aterm window's background if not). 
	  This also now works if user later changes aterm window's 
	  background color when the scrollbar is set to transparent!

	* Added command-line option "[-+]mb, and the .Xdefaults resource options: 
	  1) "menuBar": (specify "true" (ie. -mb) or "false" (+mb): to show or hide 
	  respectively) any configured menubar on startup.  You can use the new 
	  [-+]mb flag to override the "menuBar" resource setting to either force 
	  start with the menubar shown, or hidden respectively.  Default is hidden. 
	  2) "widgetFG": (color, recommended values:  "Black" for light desktop 
	  backgrounds, and the default; or "White" for dark ones).
	  Use widgetFG resource, for example, if you are using a dark desktop 
	  background theme in order to be able to see the text of menubar buttons, 
	  etc.

	* Added new menu-loading script (copied doc/menu/menu to aterm_menu.sh) 
	  to where it will be be installed by "make install" into the same */bin 
	  directory as aterm itself (within the executable path) and modify the
	  build system to make that happen.  The build changes are a bit of a 
	  hack, but I'm very new to build configurating (patches welcome)!

	* Added keyboard & menu sequences to toggle scroll & menu bars:
	  Shift+Control+M to toggle visibility of the menubar, and Shift+Control+S 
	  will toggle the scrollbar's visibility.  The corresponding menu action 
	  sequences are: "^^M" and "^^S" respectively.

	* Added a doc/README.menus file, a config.h.README file, an updated 
	  man-page and FAQ, and generally improved the documentation, particularly, 
	  the previously sparsly-documented menubar feature.

	* Update the default scrollbar button delay & repeat speeds to not be so 
	  fast (on modern processors)  See src/features.h

	* Minor code cleanups all to reduce compiler warnings and annotate all of 
	  our (non-trivial) code changes.

2024-08-02  JWT:

	* Differentiate between the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD buffers & support & set up 
	  proper mouse and key bindings for both.  aterm can now take ownership of 
	  the clipboard like other apps.

	  aterm now supports the following additional and modified bindings:

	  Alt+v (from many apps):  Paste primary

	  Control+v (from most apps):  Paste Clipboard

	  [Shift+]Control+Insert:  Copy selection to Clipboard (terms vary, so we 
	  support both).

	  Shift+Ctrl+Insert (from xterm, lxterminal):  Paste Clipboard

	  Shift+Ctrl+c:  Copy selection to Clipboard.

	  Button-1:  Clear selection & set selection anchor

	  Button-2:  Past Primary

	  Shift-Button-2:  Paste Clipboard

	  Button-3:  (Select / extend selected) text from anchor to click point.

	* Include the colon (":") in the default CUTCHARS list string (personal 
	  preference).

	* Remove unneeded and unavailable (at least on my modern Linux) the 
	  requirement for <sys/stropts.h>.

	* Start by adding pristine aterm source from circa 2018 to GitHub, 
	  plus a README & Copyright (COPYING) file taken from the main program.
